"Conditional GLOnets can apply to the design of other classes of photonic devices and more broadly to other physical systems in which device performance can be improved using gradients."

"We are also interested in applying our algorithm to more complex systems, such as 2D or 3D metasurfaces, multi-function metasurfaces, and other photonics design problems."

"New concepts that intimately combine the underlying physical structure of Maxwellâ€™s equations with machine learning need to be developed. GLOnets, which combine machine learning with physics-based solvers, is one such example showing how new hybrid algorithms can enhance the capabilities of neural networks."

"We predict that dataless training, in which physics-based calculations are used to train neural networks, will serve as a particularly effective and computationally efficient means to harnessing machine learning for photonics problems."
